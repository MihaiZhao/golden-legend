# Golden Legend Game
An old-school game based on one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, Zork. The game is developed in C++ and sqlite3, which has a database for storing the items in inventory. Beta V1 has been released with great features and improvements:  
Input Assistant – a function that helps you with the input, for instance if you press a key that is not in the menu the function informs you, even if you press a special key (ENTER, SPACE, etc.)
\nSecured Database – you cannot modify the database while you playing; if the database has externally modified before starting the game, an algorithm resets all values to default
